### Equity Indicator Brief
This example, focusing on educational attainment, is inspired by efforts like that of [St. Louis Equity Indicators Project](https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/mayor/initiatives/resilience/equity/index.cfm) emphasizing racial or ethnic disparities in measures of community well-being. The goal is to make indicators from sources like the U.S. Census American Community Survey readily accessible and reproducible. Indicators derived from sampled data, like the American Community Survey are measured with uncertainty and we aim to make that uncertainy apparent. 


### About the Indicator
BA Degree Attainment Population measures the percentage of Albemarle County adults over age 25 with a BA degree or higher. In 2017, there were `r last(equityTable_ed$ed)` (+/- `r round(last(equityTable_ed$ed_moe),0)`) adults over age 25 with a BA degree, `r round(last(equityTable_ed$Per),1)`% of all adults over 25.

## Summary Table
Adults age 25 and over that have obtained a BA degree or higher in Albemarle County

|             | Total Adults | White Adults | Black Adults | Hispanic Adults | Black-White Disparity | Hispanic-White Disparity | 
|------------|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| **Adults with a BA degree or higher** | `r last(equityTable_ed$ed)` | `r last(equityTable_ed$ed_H)` | `r last(equityTable_ed$ed_B)` | `r last(equityTable_ed$ed_I)` |  |  | 
| **Adult population**    | `r last(equityTable_ed$pop)`  | `r last(equityTable_ed$pop_H)` | `r last(equityTable_ed$pop_B)` | `r last(equityTable_ed$pop_I)` |  |  |  
| **BA Degree Attainment rate**  | `r round(last(equityTable_ed$Per),1)`% | `r round(last(equityTable_ed$Per_H),1)`% | `r round(last(equityTable_ed$Per_B),1)`% | `r round(last(equityTable_ed$Per_I),1)`% | `r round(last(equityTable_ed$Ratio_B),1)` | `r round(last(equityTable_ed$Ratio_I),1)` | 

**Data Source:** U.S. Census Bureau; American Community Survey, 2013-2017, Derived from tables B15002, C15002H, C15002I, and C15002B.

**Data Explanation:** Local population and educational attainment estimates are from the American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, 2013-2017. Sent to approximately 3.5 million addresses per year, the 5-year survey estimates provide up-to-date estimates for localities that may be changing between censuses. As these are estimates derived from surveys, and thus subject to variability due to sampling error, margins of error are included in the tables below.

### Disparity Ratio 
The disparity ratio is the percentage of black or hispanic adults (over 25) who have attained a BA degree or higher divided by the percentage of white adults (over 25) who have attained a BA degree or higher. A disparity ratio of 1 reflects racial equality; values *lower* than 1 suggest lower educational attainment rates among black or hispanic adults (over 25) compared to whites. Ratios greater than 1 suggest higher educational attainment rates among black or hispanic adults (over 25). 

* In Albemarle County, black residents have a notably lower rate of Bachelor degree attainment than do white residents. The disparity ratio shows that black residents are only `r round(last(equityTable_ed$Ratio_B),1)` as likely to have a 4-year college degree. 
* In Albemarle County, Hispanic residents have a lower rate of Bachelor degree attainment than do wite residents. The disparity ratio shows that Hispanic residents are only `r round(last(equityTable_ed$Ratio_I),1)` times as likely to have a 4-year college degree.

## BA Degree Attainment by Census Tract

Within each map, clicking on a tract will show the estimated adult (over 25) population, the estimated number of adults with a BA degree or higher,  and the estimated degree attainment rate. For educational attainment, lighter colors show lower educational attainment rates and darker colors show higher educational attainment rates.

The estimated degree attainment rate within Census tracts for black residents in Albemarle county runs the full range -- from 0% to 100%. Many of the tracts with apparently high rates of degree attainment are based on very small estimated populations. They are, as a result, very uncertain estimates. Focusing on the tracts with more substantial populations of black residents:

* Tract 105, including the Pantops neighborhood, has one of the highest degree attainment rates, at 59%, with an estimated population of 503 black adults.

The three tracts with the largest estimated populations of black residents have among the lowest estimated degree attainment rates for black residents.

* Tract 107, capturing part of the Places 29 South neighbhorhood, with an estimated population of 1,230 black adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 8%.
Tract 106.01, situated within the Places 29 South neighborhood, with an estimated population of 579 black adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 5%.
* Tract 114, at the southern corner of the county, with an estimated population of 692 black adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 4%.

```

While several tracts have very high estimates of degree attainment among the adult Hispanic population, all of the regions with estimated rates above 50% are based on  small estimated populations. They are, as a result, very uncertain estimates. The estimated degree attainment rates in the tracts with more substantial Hisapnic populations are:

* Tract 103, encompassing much of the Places 29 North neighborhod, with an estimated population of 286 Hispanic adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 35%.
* Tract 113.01, east of US 29 and south of SR 55, with an estimated poulation of 198 Hispanic adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 27%.
* Tract 102.01, along the northern edge of the county along US 29, with an estimated populaiton of 224 Hispanic adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 17%.
* Tract 113.02, within the Southern Neighborhood and home to the Southwood Mobile Home Park, with an estimated populaiton of 665 Hispanic adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 9%.
* Tract 107, capturing part of the Places 29 South neighbhorhood, with an estimated populaiton of 401 Hispanic adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 2%.

            title = paste("BA Degree Attainment<br>among White Adults (25+)", sep = ""))
```

Among the Albemarle County Census tracts with the highest estimated degree attainment rates among white residents:

* Tract 109.01, situated in the Western Neighborhood, with an estimated population of 521 white adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 89%.
* Tract 110, intersecting with the Western Neighborhoods and out towards Ivy, with an estimated population of 4,191 white adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 80%.
* Tract 106.02, containing the eastern portion of the Places 29 South neighborhood, with an estimated population of 2,335 white adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 77%.

Only two Census tracts within Albemarle have estimated degree attainment rates of less than 40% among white residents.

* Tract 114, at the southern corner of the county, with an estimated population of 2,331 white adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 35%.
* Tract 113.01, east of US 29 and south of SR 55, with an estimated population of 3,987 white adults and an estimated degree attainment rate of 30%.

## Data Tables
The following tables show the population estimates and BA degree attainment rates for each census tract. The tables also provide the margains of error associated with each estimate. ACS data is based on a sample and so estimates contain a degree of uncertainty. Larger margins mean the estimate is less accurate. Typically the larger the sample size, the smaller the margin of error. This means in cases where the population of interest is very small (very few adults (over 25) live in a census tract), estimates can be very unreliable. 

### Missing values
In the BA degree attainment rate table, NaN's exist when there is division by zero, that is, when the population of interest in that census tract is estimated to be zero. BA degree attainment rate estimates of zero occur when the number of BA degrees or higher earned in that census tract is zero.
