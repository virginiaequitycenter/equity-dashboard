# 3. Reduce data, add county FIPS ----

# In spot checking the data frame, there are many that have historic district in the name, and 
# might not be worth including
# there are also several points within larger polygons that appear to be redundant. 

# View(parks[str_detect(parks$name, pattern = "Historic"),])
# As of 09/29/2022, these "parks" include
# Albemarle Historic District
# Charlottesville and Albemarle County Courthouse Historic District
# Rugby Road-University Corner Historic District
# University of Virginia Historic District
# Scottsville Historic District
# Wertland Street Historic District
# Ridge Street Historic District
# Fluvanna County Courthouse Historic District

## Forming a subset of just the historic districts to map them

## None of these appear to capture any green space, except for "University of Virginia Historic District"
# which really just includes the lawn. Other data sources we considered for the parks data 
# also included the lawn; It could potentially be worth including in the future because certainly other people 
# outside the UVA community access the lawn, but those often seem to be tourists. 
# but for now, I'm excluding it along with the other historic districts. 

parks <- parks[parks$name %in% historic$name == F,]

## Spot checking for redundancies and point/polygon inconsistencies:
### As of 12/09/2022
# there are a lot of parks with repeated names, but R doesn't recognize them as duplicated rows because the 
# geometries are ever-so-slightly different. 
# Getting rid of repeated names 
parks <- parks[order(parks$name),]
parks <- parks[!duplicated(parks$name),]

### From previous run ###########################################################################
# Polygon for Fry Spring's Park and point for Fry's Spring Beach Club (only keeping polygon)
# Polygon for Northeast Park and a point for "Northeast Park Southbound" (only keeping polygon)

# Point for Pen Park, but no polygon (Cville/Albemarle)
# Point for Brook Hill River Park, but no polygon (Cville/Albemarle)
# Point for Carysbrook Sports Complex, but no polygon (Buckingham)
# Point for Carys Creek Wayside, but no polygon (Buckingham)
